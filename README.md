# Overview

This project is a simple demonstration of how the "Add to Cart" functionality works in an e-commerce web application. It shows a basic shopping experience where users can:

Browse a list of products

Add individual items to a cart

View a cart summary with real-time updates

See the total price calculated dynamically

Proceed to checkout (non-functional, just for demonstration)

The goal is to showcase adding to cart logic, including state management for items and price updates.
